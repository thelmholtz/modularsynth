## Modular Synth

Web audio API wrapper with analogue styled modules.
Basic substractive synth implementation.

#### Usage

While the webapp is dependency free, you might want to run `npm install` and then `node liteserver.js` to run local and avoid CORS issues with static files.

You can play around with the prototype to this version on [codepen](https://codepen.io/Helmholtz/pen/YZpQXg), featuring some horrible code and some features not yet implemented here.

### A list of TODOs:
- Add touch/mouse control and a sleek UI
- Add WebMidiAPI wrappers
- Change canvas to WebGL. Fix some video performance issues.
